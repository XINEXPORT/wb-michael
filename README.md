# wb-michael
## This is a Michael Meyers Adventure game exercise for WEB DEVELOPMENT - DALLAS FT3, DevMountain.
I re-created from wb-mars but re-wrote the language and logic to make it unique to me.
Youâ€™ll practice capturing user input, producing dynamic output, using conditional statements and comparison operators, and converting data types.
